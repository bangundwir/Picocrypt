Picocrypt is a very small (hence <i>Pico</i>), very simple, yet very secure encryption tool that you can use to protect your files. It's designed to be the <i>go-to</i> tool for file encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity, and reliability. Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher by default and the Argon2id key derivation function, with an optional AES‚Äë256‚ÄëCTR mode for compatibility scenarios.

# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Project archived ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Picocrypt has been permanently archived and frozen into a read-only state.

Read the [reason](https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/issues/134) why. ***Please read it carefully and fully**; it's not the format you might expect.*

**Picocrypt is still fully functional, stable, and secure as is. You can continue using it confidently.**

Archiving Picocrypt doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it, just that I'm done working on it.

A community-developed successor to Picocrypt is available and called [Picocrypt NG](https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG).

‚ö†Ô∏è **I do not endorse, develop, nor support Picocrypt NG; use it at your own risk.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Picocrypt NG is not subject to the same rigorous testing and design I applied to Picocrypt.

# Downloads

‚ÑπÔ∏è **You are highly recommended to read through the [Features](https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt?tab=readme-ov-file#features) section below to fully understand the features and limitations of Picocrypt before using it.** ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Make sure to only download Picocrypt from this repository to ensure that you get the authentic and backdoor-free Picocrypt. When sharing Picocrypt with others, be sure to link to this repository to prevent any confusion. Besides this repository, there is no official website/webpage or mobile apps for Picocrypt. For example, beware of picocrypt.org ([archive.org snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20240816235513/http://picocrypt.org/)), which claimed to be the official website for this project.

## Windows
To download the latest, standalone, and portable executable for Windows, click <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt.exe">here</a>. If it won't start, see <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/issues/91">here</a> for a solution or use the installer below which automatically fixes the issue (recommended).

If you use Picocrypt frequently, you can also download the [installer](https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/download/1.49/Installer.exe) for easy access, automatic file extension association, and bundled compatibility helpers. Administrator privileges are not required to run the installer.

If your antivirus flags Picocrypt as a virus, please report it as a false positive to help everyone.

## macOS
Download Picocrypt <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt.dmg">here</a>, open the container, and drag Picocrypt to your Applications. You will need to manually trust the app from a terminal if macOS prevents you from opening it:
```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Picocrypt.app
```

Note: the macOS app is built for Apple silicon only. If you're still on Intel, you can build from source.

**Warning: Picocrypt will cease to work on macOS in the future** because Apple doesn't care about backwards compatibility. Once OpenGL is removed and/or GLFW compatibility is broken, Picocrypt will no longer work and it will be very difficult to fix. If you're a macOS user, you're probably better off using the CLI or Web version instead. Maybe also consider using an OS that actually somewhat cares about its developers and users...

## Linux
Download the raw binary <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt">here</a> (you may need the packages below). Alternatively, try the <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt.deb">.deb</a> or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.picocrypt.Picocrypt">Flatpak</a>.
```
sudo apt install -y libc6 libgcc-s1 libgl1 libgtk-3-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6
```

## CLI
A command-line interface is available for Picocrypt <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/CLI">here</a>. It can encrypt and decrypt files, folders, and glob patterns, and supports paranoid mode and Reed-Solomon encoding. You can use it on systems that don't have a GUI or can't run the GUI app.

## Web
A functionally limited web app is available <a href="https://picocrypt.github.io/">here</a> which allows you to encrypt and decrypt standard Picocrypt volumes (no advanced features or keyfiles) on any modern browser, including mobile devices. It's a simple, future-proof way to securely encrypt files that should work indefinitely due to the web's stable nature. Note that you can only encrypt/decrypt single files up to a maximum size of 512 MiB.

Keep in mind that while Picocrypt does most things better than other tools, it's not a one-size-fits-all and doesn't try to be. There are use cases such as full-disk encryption where VeraCrypt and BitLocker would be a better (and the only) choice. So while Picocrypt is a great choice for the majority of people doing file encryption, you should still do your own research and use what's best for you.

# Features
Picocrypt is a very simple tool and most users will intuitively understand how to use it in a few seconds. On a basic level, simply dropping your files, entering a password, and hitting Encrypt is all that's needed to encrypt your files. Dropping the output back into Picocrypt, entering the password, and hitting Decrypt is all that's needed to decrypt those files. Pretty simple, right?

While being simple, Picocrypt also strives to be powerful in the hands of knowledgeable and advanced users. Thus, there are some additional options that you may use to suit your needs. Read through their descriptions carefully as some of them can be complex to use correctly.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Password generator</strong>: Picocrypt provides a secure password generator that you can use to create cryptographically secure passwords. You can customize the password length, as well as the types of characters to include.</li>
	<li><strong>Comments</strong>: Use this to store <strong>non-sensitive</strong> text along with the volume (<strong>it won't be encrypted</strong> and simply can't be by design). For example, you can put a description of the file you're encrypting before sending it to someone. When the person you sent it to drops the volume into Picocrypt, your description will be shown to that person. Or, if you're backing up personal files, you can give a description of the volume's contents so you can quickly remind yourself without having to fully decrypt. Since comments are neither encrypted nor authenticated, it can be freely read and modified by an attacker. <strong>Thus, it should only be used for non-sensitive, informational purposes in trusted environments.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Keyfiles</strong>: Picocrypt supports the use of keyfiles as an additional form of authentication (or the only form of authentication). Any file can be used as a keyfile, and a secure keyfile generator is provided for convenience. Not only can you use multiple keyfiles, but you can also require the correct order of keyfiles to be present for a successful decryption to occur. A particularly good use case of multiple keyfiles is creating a shared volume, where each person holds a keyfile, and all of them (and their keyfiles) must be present to decrypt the shared volume. By checking the "Require correct order" box and dropping your keyfile in last, you can also ensure that you'll always be the one clicking the Decrypt button. <strong>Use the keyfile generator whenever possible for the best security.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Paranoid mode</strong>: Using this mode will encrypt your data with both XChaCha20 and Serpent in a cascade fashion, and use HMAC-SHA3 to authenticate data instead of BLAKE2b. Argon2 parameters will be increased significantly as well. This is recommended for protecting top-secret files and provides the highest level of practical security attainable. For a hacker to break into your encrypted data, both the XChaCha20 cipher and the Serpent cipher must be broken, assuming you've chosen a good password. It's safe to say that in this mode, your files are impossible to crack. Keep in mind, however, that this mode is slower and isn't really necessary unless you're a government agent with classified data or a whistleblower under threat.</li>
	<li><strong>AES‚Äë256‚ÄëCTR mode</strong>: Choose AES‚Äë256‚ÄëCTR instead of XChaCha20 if you need AES compatibility. Authentication and KDF remain identical to normal mode (BLAKE2b + Argon2id). Nonce/IVs are rotated safely during long streams.</li>
	<li><strong>Reed-Solomon</strong>: This feature is very useful if you are planning to archive important data on a cloud provider or external medium for a long time. If checked, Picocrypt will use the Reed-Solomon error correction code to add 8 extra bytes for every 128 bytes of data to prevent file corruption. This means that up to ~3% of your file can corrupt and Picocrypt will still be able to correct the errors and decrypt your files with no corruption. Of course, if your file corrupts very badly (e.g., you dropped your hard drive), Picocrypt won't be able to fully recover your files, but it will try its best to recover what it can. Note that this option will slow down encryption and decryption speeds significantly.</li>
	<li><strong>Force decrypt</strong>: Picocrypt automatically checks for file integrity upon decryption. If the file has been modified or is corrupted, Picocrypt will automatically delete the output for the user's safety. If you would like to override these safeguards, check this option. Also, if this option is checked and the Reed-Solomon feature was used on the encrypted volume, Picocrypt will attempt to recover as much of the file as possible during decryption.</li>
	<li><strong>Split into chunks</strong>: Don't feel like dealing with gargantuan files? No worries! With Picocrypt, you can choose to split your output file into custom-sized chunks, so large files can become more manageable and easier to upload to cloud providers. Simply choose a unit (KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB) and enter your desired chunk size for that unit. To decrypt the chunks, simply drag one of them into Picocrypt and the chunks will be automatically recombined during decryption.</li>
	<li><strong>Compress files</strong>: By default, Picocrypt uses a zip file with no compression to quickly merge files together when encrypting multiple files. If you would like to compress these files, however, simply check this box and the standard Deflate compression algorithm will be applied during encryption.</li>
	<li><strong>Deniability</strong>: Picocrypt volumes typically follow an easily recognizable header format. However, if you want to hide the fact that you are encrypting your files, enabling this option will provide you with plausible deniability. The output volume will indistinguishable from a stream of random bytes, and no one can prove it is a volume without the correct password. This can be useful in an authoritarian country where the only way to transport your files safely is if they don't "exist" in the first place. Keep in mind that this mode slows down encryption and decryption speeds, requires you to manually rename the volume afterward, renders comments useless, and also voids the extra security precautions of the paranoid mode, so you should only use it if absolutely necessary. <strong>If you've never heard of plausible deniability, this feature is not for you.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Recursively</strong>: If you want to encrypt and/or decrypt a large set of files individually, this option will tell Picocrypt to go through every recursive file that you drop in and encrypt/decrypt it separately. This is useful, for example, if you are encrypting thousands of large documents and want to be able to decrypt any one of them in particular without having to download and decrypt the entire set of documents. <strong>Keep in mind that this is a very complex feature that should only be used if you know what you are doing.</strong></li>
</ul>

# Security
For more information on how Picocrypt handles cryptography, see <a href="Internals.md">Internals</a> for the technical details. If you're worried about the safety of me or this project, let me assure you that this repository won't be hijacked or backdoored. I have 2FA (TOTP) enabled on all accounts with a tie to Picocrypt (GitHub, etc.), in addition to full-disk encryption on all of my portable devices. For further hardening, Picocrypt uses my isolated forks of dependencies and I fetch upstream only when I have taken a look at the changes and believe that there aren't any security issues. This means that if a dependency gets hacked or deleted by the author, Picocrypt will be using my fork of it and remain completely unaffected. I've also meticulously gone through every single setting in the Picocrypt organization and repos, locking down access behind multiple layers of security such as read-only base-level member permissions, required PRs and mandatory approvals (which no one can do but me), mandatory CODEOWNERS approvals, and I'm the only member of the Picocrypt organization and repos. You can feel confident about using Picocrypt as long as you understand:

<strong>Picocrypt operates under the assumption that the host machine it is running on is safe and trusted. If that is not the case, no piece of software will be secure, and you will have much bigger problems to worry about. As such, Picocrypt is designed for the offline security of volumes and does not attempt to protect against side-channel analysis.</strong>

# Donations
When I was actively developing Picocrypt, I accepted donations, but now that Picocrypt is complete and production-ready, there's no need anymore. Instead, take your time and effort to share the love of Picocrypt with others. Donations are nice, but being able to help others is a lot more valuable to me than a few spare dollars. Knowing that Picocrypt is helping people secure their files is plenty enough for me.

# FAQ
**Does the "Delete files" feature shred files?**

No, it doesn't shred any files and just deletes them as your file manager would. On modern storage mediums like SSDs, there is no such thing as shredding a file since wear leveling makes it impossible to overwrite a particular sector. Thus, to prevent giving users a false sense of security, Picocrypt doesn't include any shredding features at all.

**Is Picocrypt quantum-secure?**

Yes, Picocrypt is secure against quantum computers. All of the cryptography used in Picocrypt works off of a private key, and private-key cryptography is considered to be resistant against all current and future developments, including quantum computers.
